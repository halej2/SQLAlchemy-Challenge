# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
In this project I:
1. Used SQLAlchemy and Python to connect to a SQL database and query data into Panda dataframes
2. Create data visualizations using Matplotlib
3. Create a Flask API application to return queried data as JSON

SQLAlchemy Connection and Data Visualizations Notebook: .ipynb_checkpoints folder
Flask API App: SurfsUp App folder

Note: To complete this assignment, I referenced Week 10 classwork assignments and guidance in class office hours
